                    <p> All sessions are one-on-one to ensure the session is as productive as possible. I offer a free assessment for new students as a diagnostic tool to help us in our work. I can provide curricular materials and additional homework problems if desired. <br></br><br></br>Both online and in-person sessions are available. In-person sessions take place in the Eugene/Springfield, OR area. All sessions cost $50/hour.

                        About Clare</h1>
                    <p> I have nearly a decade of math tutoring experience, both online and in-person. I have a degree in mathematics from the University of Oregon with an emphasis on analysis and probability. I’m passionate about helping students develop confidence in their own mathematical abilities, and I believe in an affirming approach to mathematics education that supports students as learners.
                        <br /><br />
                        My goal as a tutor is to make mathematics accessible, rewarding, and enriching for all my students. I take a proactive and highly personalized approach that empowers your student as a learner based on their unique needs and goals. I love seeing students realize their potential as mathematical learners, and I would love to partner with your student to help them succeed and excel.
                        <br /><br />
