This is a freelance project created for a client who runs a mathematics tutoring center. 

This project required a hybrid site with dynamic and static pages. Next.js was selected for its ability to generate both as well as for the sake of SEO. 

Most pages are simple static display pages which are meant primarilly to convey the information the client requested. Images are from undraw, a open source image repository. 

The contact form makes use of EmailJs to enable communication between sustomers and the tutoring center.

The only dynamically generated pages are the blog page and the individual blog post pages which use dynamic routing to generate unique blog post links.
